// Exercises: simple loops


// EXERCISE: Multiplication Tables

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").



// EXERCISE: The even/odd reporter

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").
