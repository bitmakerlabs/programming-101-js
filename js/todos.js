// First let's practice using events. 
// TIP - Comment out the previous exercise when starting the next one

// 1. Get the browser to write to the console when someone clicks anywhere in the document

// 2. Change the text of the h1 that displays the page title when someone clicks anywhere in the page

// 3. Display an alert when someone clicks any of the tasks

// 4a. Write a function that displays an alert
// 4b. Run the function only when any task is clicked


// Now let's get the application to do what it needs to do
// Write a function that updates the counter based on which tasks are completed


// Run the function you just wrote to update the counter


// Add an event listener to each of the tasks which will toggle the 'is-complete' css class when clicked
